User Stories:
* A user can log in/out, change password, delete account.
* A user will be presented randomly with a capital to practice.
* A user can enter their answer.
* A user will be told if their answer is correct.
* A user's past learning will be remembered.
* When a user gets a capital correct three times consecutively,
the capital is removed from the user's account.

This project was developed over a one-week period.
Eventually, I plan to develop a version which incorporates
spaced interval learning, and which allows learning of world capitals.

Future user stories:
* A user can choose which area's capitals they want to learn.
* A user will be presented with 5-10 new capitals each day.
* A user will be presented with reviews to past capitals each day.
* As a user repeatedly demonstrates they remember a capital, the length of time between reviews will lengthen (spaced repetition).
